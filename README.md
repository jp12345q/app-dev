**Sypnosis**
>- Arata Kaizaki is a 27-year-old NEET who is unable to find stable work. One night he meets Ryo Yoake from the ReLIFE Laboratory who offers him participation in the ReLIFE Project. Arata accepts and soon learns ReLIFE involves him taking a pill that makes him appear seventeen again, and enrolling as a third-year high school student at Aoba High School. He meets fellow classmates: Kazuomi Oga, Rena Kariu, An Onoya, Chizuru Hishiro and Ryo who has also taken the medicine to support Kaizaki while enrolled in school. Ryo explains to Arata that ReLIFE is an opportunity for him to relive his youth in an attempt to change his current self. From there, Arata's ReLIFE experience begins.
>- Arata becomes acquainted with his classmates Kazuomi, An, and Rena who sit next to him. He learns about Rena's competitive nature and her disappointment in losing the position of class representative to fellow classmate Chizuru. Arata formally meets Chizuru during lunch, however, her blunt and to-the-point approach throw him for a loop. They meet again after school where Chizuru shares with Arata that she is socially awkward, and does not understand people, or know how to communicate with them, but wants to change that about herself. Arata gives her encouragement, and they become friends after exchanging phone numbers. 
> - During gym class Arata ends up hurting himself, and Ryo explains despite his youthful appearance Arata's body is still biologically 27-year-old man. Meanwhile, Chizuru takes Arata's advice to try smiling more in an attempt to make friends, but her forced smiles are misinterpreted by Rena as Chizuru mocking her. Rena learns that despite viewing Chizuru as an academic rival Chizuru was unaware of who Rena was, causing Rena's perception of both Chizuru and herself to be strained.
>- Chizuru's continued attempts at smiling have the unintended effect of lowering Rena's self-worth due to her misconception Chizuru's actions are out of spite. Rena reflects that she measures her self-worth by her success and that the previous year she had both pride and happiness due to being the class representative alongside Kazuomi, whom she has feelings for. Now having lost both the class representative position and the place at Kazuomi's side to Chizuru, Rena begins to think less of herself, and grows angrier towards Chizuru for thinking she is mocking her for her shortcomings. Chizuru, however, is unaware of Rena's feelings and confides in Arata that she feels that she and Rena are becoming friends. One night after staying late at school, Rena sees Chizuru has stayed late so steals her school bag in retaliation for her perceived mistreatment, and she is caught by Arata. As Arata attempts to stop her, they both fall down a flight of stairs.
>- Arata awakens in the school infirmary after the fall he and Rena had. Remembering Rena was stealing Chizuru's bag before they fell, Arata recalls a similar situation at a company he worked for where his senior was bullied by her co-workers due to their jealousy of her. When Rena awakens, Arata confronts her about her actions and Rena shares her feelings of insecurity and frustration towards Chizuru. Arata encourages her not to stoop to the level of harassing people she does not like, and to continue being a person who perseveres to obtain what she wants. After leaving, Arata meets Chizuru who suspects Rena was trying to steal her bag, but could not think of a reason why. Arata confirms Chizuru's suspicions, and she decides to speak with Rena as she is leaving the school. Rena explains her feelings towards Chizuru and learns that Chizuru never meant to degrade her and was only attempting to be her friend. With the confusion cleared up, Rena apologizes and agrees to be Chizuru's friend on the condition that Chizuru acknowledges Rena as a rival.
>- Kazuomi and An pay a visit to Arata's apartment for a study session due to both Arata and An repeatedly scoring poorly on their previous tests. When Kazuomi leaves early, An confesses to Arata that they met previously and she fell in love with him at first sight. Ryo decides to check up (eavesdrop) on Arata via his cell phone but learns An and Arata are alone and he rushes to the apartment. An attempts to kiss Arata, but he stops her just as Ryo arrives. Ryo scolds An for her actions, and she reveals she was only testing Arata, and she is actually Ryo's 27-year-old coworker at ReLIFE Laboratory. An also explains she was supposed to be Arata's support person, but Ryo had to step into her role since she was not able complete her training in time. Both An and Ryo apologize for the trouble she caused, with Ryo secretly apologizing for partially lying of why he is Arata's supporter.
>- As Ryo is writing his report on Arata's progress, he remembers when he was supporting subject 001 of the ReLIFE project. Ryo was scolded by his supervisors for being too involved in the subject's life, and thus he had to distanced himself from the subject. At that time, he was asked to scout out Arata to potentially be subject 002 in the ReLIFE project. After a year had passed, the results for subject 001 were deemed a failure as the person in question had not changed at all. Discouraged by his failure to support subject 001, Ryo is encouraged by An not to give up as Arata was selected to be subject 002. Ryo had been assigned as his supporter. Ryo concludes his report by logging despite Arata's struggles he is making progress.
>- Honoka and Arata take a makeup test. Honoka passes but Arata did not. Rena stands up for Honoka when other volleyball members make fun of her. Honoka passes out as she studied too hard to pass the makeup test. Unfortunately, this causes Rena to have an accident, and their friendship is strained.
>- Chizuru understands there is a problem and talks with Arata. Talking about the problem causes Arata to confront his past mistake with Chizuru and they plan to make Rena and Honoka friends again. Akira and Nobu bring Rena and Kazuomi and listen to a private discussion among Honoka, Arata, and Chizuru.
>- Honoka explains the reason she joined Aoba HS. Chizuru talks about her past and motivates Honoka to talk with Rena. Rena runs away before Honoka can talk with her. At the day of the match Chizuru motivates Rena to play. Rena finally agrees to play. Rena and Honoka make up. They lose but have a great time.
>- Arata confronts his past and pays a visit to his senpai's grave. Ryo plans a surprise for him.
>- Arata indirectly explains to Kazuomi about love and how important it is. When Kazuomi and Arata see a man with Rena, Kazuomi rushes to her. He learns Rena had a heat stroke and the man had helped her. Kazuomi walks Rena home. That night, he realizes that he loves Rena and asks for advice from everyone. He later decides how to proceed. Kazuomi invites Rena to the Summer Festival. Rena asks advice from the other girls on what she should do next.
>- Rena asks for Honoka and Chizuru's assistance in getting her and Kazuomi alone during the fireworks festival in order for her to confess her feelings to him. At the festival, Arata, An, Ryo, Chizuru, and the others split up in order to let Kazuomi and Rena be alone, as they knew Kazuomi was also planning on confessing to Rena. Ryo and An also make it so that Arata and Chizuru ended up alone together too. Rena and Kazuomi confess their feelings towards one another, and as the fireworks begin Chizuru tells Arata she was happy to meet him. Chizuru recalls the events that have happened since the start of the school year, and before then when she met Ryo, and became subject 001 in the ReLIFE project. After the festival ends, Arata walks Chizuru home, and realizes he has fallen in love with her, but decides against telling her since everyone he met in school will forget him once his ReLIFE ends. Instead he tells Chizuru he will never forget her, and she also tells him that she will never forget him.

 >- Chizuru loses the position of class representative to Rena. Realizing she was preoccupied with her feelings for Arata, Chizuru confronts Ryo asking him if Arata is a ReLIFE subject. He doesn't want to confirm it, warning her that exposing a test subject would end the experiment for him and they would never see each other again. Ryo reveals to her that An works for ReLIFE and is her new supervisor. An suggests Chizuru wants Arata to be a test subject, as she could act on her feelings if he were a grown-up.
